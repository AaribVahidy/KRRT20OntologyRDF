# Cricket Match Data Analysis with SPARQL Queries

This project is focused on analyzing cricket match data using SPARQL queries on an RDF graph. The goal is to extract useful insights from the data, such as team performance, player statistics, match summaries, and various cricket-related metrics.

## Project Overview

The project involves building and querying an RDF dataset representing cricket match statistics. It uses SPARQL queries to retrieve and process data related to runs, wickets, boundaries, players, and teams, among other metrics. The queries are designed to answer common cricket analysis

Key entities in the RDF graph include:
- **Match**: Each match is represented with attributes such as match ID, teams involved, runs scored, balls played, wickets taken, venue.
- **Team**: Each team has associated data such as the number of matches played, tosses won, runs scored, wickets taken

- # Technologies Used

- **SPARQL**: For querying the RDF dataset.
- **Python**: The queries are run using Python's `rdflib` library to handle the RDF graph.
- **RDF**: Resource Description Framework is used to represent the cricket data in a structured, graph-based format.
- **RDFLib**: A Python library for working with RDF data and executing SPARQL queries.
